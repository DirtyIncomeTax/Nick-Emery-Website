      <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <div class="project-item"></div>
          <img src="images/Profile Picture.jpg" alt="Nick Emery">
          <p class="project-item content-wrap">I am a 2nd year undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology seeking a degree in Computational Media, 
          with a concentration in People and Games. I hope to,one day, put my military experience and technical education to work in the 
          world of video games and digital media.</p>
          <p class="project-item content-wrap">Simply put: I adore video games. My entire life, I have loved media; movies, music, comics, art, 
          but none do I love more than games. Since I can remember, I have wanted to work in the games indusrty. 
          I don't just want to help make games, I want to be involved at every level of development - art, design, production, 
          narrative, everything. I want to re-create those feelings I had when I first stepped onto the ring-world of Halo 
          or explored ancient ruins in Uncharted for a new generation of players. Even through my years in the Marines, 
          I always held onto the dream of, one day, working at a studio creating a new world for gamers to explore.
          At Georgie Tech, I hope to gain all the skills, resources, and knowledge I need to make that dream a reality.

      <h2 class="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
        <p class="project-item content-wrap">As I am a new student to Georgia Tech, and have no projects to show, everything I work on from here on will be 
          posted <a href="html/portfolio.html">here.</a>
        </p>

      <h2 class="work">Work Experience</h2>
        <p class="project-item content-wrap">While I am now at Georgia Tech studying Game Design and Digital Media, 
          before I was a full-time student I spent many years in the United States Marine Corps. 
          The first five years were on Active Duty and the other three were in the Reserves 
          while I studied at Georgia Gwinnett College. I was a Communications Technician primarily, as well as a 
          Cryptographic Key Maintainer and an Inventory Manager. For more information on my work experience, 
          look <a href="html/work.html">here.</a>
        </p>

      <h2 class="education">Education</h2>
        <p class="project-item content-wrap"> Before Georgia Tech, I studied at Georgia Gwinnett College in 
          Lawrenceville, GA. Prior to that I was a part of many military training programs and schools.
