                <p class="project-item content-wrap">I spent eight years in the United States Marine Corps. The first five years were on Active Duty and the other 
                    three were in the Reserves while I studied at Georgia Gwinnett College. I was a Communications Technician primarily, 
                    as well as a Cryptographic Key Maintainer and an Inventory Manager.
